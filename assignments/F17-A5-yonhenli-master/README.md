## To-Do
- [ ] Read the [instructions](instructions.pdf).
- [ ] Add the function implementation of `Node *my_reverse(Node *head)` to [node.c](node.c).
- [ ] Test your function implementations to [main.c](main.c). _Hint: you might find it helpful to also define a function `void print(Node *n)` which pretty-prints the contents of a node given its address as an argument._
- [ ] Complete the `all` and `main` rules in [Makefile](Makefile).
- [ ] When you are done with your work, make a submission on MyCourses with the 7-digit hash of the commit you want graded as the submission's comment.
